                    Hi! My name is Lex and I'm a 21 year old junior full-stack web dev and computer science student.
                    When I was six my parents bought me a first generation PlayStation and that was the part where I became a huge nerd.
                    Ever since, I've been fascinated by art, technology, and any other inbetweens, and have strived to make that my career.    
                    I aim to create stellar projects, adapt to whatever the situation calls, and to animate visions that capture others the same way they did me.
                </p>
