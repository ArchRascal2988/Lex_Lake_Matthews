                    Hi! My name is Lex and I'm a 21 year old junior full-stack web dev and computer science student.
                    When I was six my parents bought me a first generation PlayStation,
                    and that was the meet cute for me and programming.
                    Ever since, I've been fascinated by art, technology, and any other inbetweens.
                    I aim to create quality projects, adapting to whatever the situation calls, 
                    and to envision creations that capture others the same way they did me.
                </p>
